Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project. 
The aim of this project is to gain insights into the dataset through non-graphical and graphical analysis, 
identify patterns, and provide actionable recommendations.

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Overview **:
   - Observations on the shape of data.
   - Data types of all attributes.
   - Conversion of categorical attributes to 'category' (if required).
   - Missing value detection.
   - Statistical summary.

2. **Non-Graphical Analysis **:
   - Value counts and unique attributes.

3. **Visual Analysis**:
   - Univariate and bivariate analysis after pre-processing.
   - Pre-processing involves unnesting data in columns  Country.

4. **Missing Value & Outlier Check**:
   - box plots for outlier detection

5. **Recommendations**:
   - Actionable items for business.
